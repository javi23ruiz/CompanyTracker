# CompanyTracker
The goal of the project is to catch sparsed news across the web, filter them, 
send an email, and generate a summary and podcast with the news. 

## Motivation of the project?
Nowadays there are a wide range of different sources of information. If an individual is interested in a particular company, he/she has to search for a vast number of sources to get an idea of what is going on with the company. However, with this solution a user can receive a summary of the top news within seconds. Therefore, less time will be spent on googling news articles, everything will be sent to you right away by executing this application. 

## Main features of the project

1. Mail Sender: Module to send an email to a user with the links of the news including a summary (applying NLP techniques), source of the news, date published and an image if found. 
2. Podcast generator: Module to generate a .mp3 file with the audio of the summary of the news.
